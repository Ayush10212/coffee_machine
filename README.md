# ☕ Coffee Machine Project

This is a terminal-based Python program that simulates a coffee machine. Users can order drinks like **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino**, insert coins (supports decimal values), and the machine checks resources, processes payment, and serves coffee with change.

## 🚀 Features

- Choose from espresso, latte, or cappuccino
- Resource tracking (water, milk, coffee, money)
- Accepts coins as float input (e.g. `2.5 quarters`)
- Returns change if overpaid
- Rejects invalid or insufficient inputs
- Shows report of current machine status
- Allows turning off the machine with `off` command

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush10212/coffe_machine.git
   cd coffe_machine
